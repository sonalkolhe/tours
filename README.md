# VFL-TRAVELs

This is the site which i have made for an as my miniproject, one of my best looking project, this site uses html css javascript tailwind and lots of dedication, this is simple elegant and also have robust features.
This site is performance dedicated and the full site loads in less than 1 mb, the second page contains the 5 data set which are dynamic and the this loads the distance of the tour from the current location, it internally uses a api and displays the approximate distance.
